The goal of this project was to clean up the HTML code source for a website. It is necessary to have a website that meets accessibility standards.

To accomplish my goal, I added "alt" tags to images, worked on proper indentation, replaced &lt;div&gt; with semantic elements, and fixed section id's to fix broken links.
